Add password change


Add a todo list account manager in admin panel where admins can look at users, passowrds and all todo items and
otehr details.

Admins can delete any accounts and add or remove any todo items from any account.u
use an encruption menthod and saftey method  so that ppl who dont have admin password cant just "curl" and get
all the data, or use anything else. just make it rlly secure and safe.
and admins can look at normal accounts (meaning the account of the website ,not the accoutns of todo, admisn
can see todo accounts and normal accounts.)
